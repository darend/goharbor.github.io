      <description>Project Harbor has released version 1.6.0 with several new features such as Helm charts management, improved LDAP support, image replication, and database migrations. A big thank you to the community for your incredible continued support!
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it what&amp;rsquo;s new:
Helm charts management Helm has become the de facto package manager of Kubernetes, making it easy to to deploy a vast array of applications. We see a dedicated Helm chart repository as a must-have system to help build new enterprise IT infrastructure and platforms.</description>

      <description>Harbor Joins the CNCF Today we are thrilled to announce that Harbor has become an official top-level CNCF project, joining the ranks of other widely-used cloud native projects like Rook, SPIFFE, Spire, Open Policy Agent, CloudEvents and Telepresence. Harbor will enter the CNCF as a sandbox project as we continue to add features and functionality desired by our community.
Harbor would simply not be where it is today if it wasn’t for our community’s engagement through issues, pull requests, discussions, code, documentation, and many other contributions.</description>

      <description>Hello world! We&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on our new Harbor site, and we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to finally open it up to the world!
For those unfamiliar with Harbor, it is an open source cloud native registry with a focus on storing, scanning and securing content. Born out of a need for such a project at VMware, the registry&amp;rsquo;s roadmap and feature velocity is influenced by our community of users and developers.</description>
